# Introduction

## About

Robocode is a [programming game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_game) where the goal is to code an autonomous bot to compete against other bots in a virtual battle arena. A player is a programmer of a bot, who have no direct influence on the game. Instead, the player must write the program of a bot containing commands for how the bot must behave and react to various events occurring during a battle. The name Robocode is short for*Robot code*.

## Motto

The bots in game are virtual tanks that must fight each other to become the last bot standing like in a [battle royale game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_royale_game). Hence, the motto of Robocode is: **Build the best - destroy the rest!**

## Purpose

The game is designed to help you and others learn how to program and have fun while learning it. It also fits for studying or improving [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) in a fast running real-time game.
