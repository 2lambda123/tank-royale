# What is Robocode?

Robocode is a [programming game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_game) where the goal is to code a bot in the
form of a virtual tank to compete against other bots in a virtual battle arena. The player is the programmer of the bot,
who will have no direct influence on the game. Instead, the player must write a program for the brain of the bot. The
program is telling how the bot must behave and react to events occurring in the battle arena.

The name _Robocode_ originates from an [older version of the game](https://robocode.sourceforge.io/) and is a short
for "Robot code". With this new version, the world "bot" is used instead of "robot".

The game is designed to help you learn how to program and improve your programming skills and have fun while doing it.
Robocode is also useful when studying or improving [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)
in a fast-running real-time game.

Robocode's battles take place on a battlefield, where small automated tank bots fight it out until only one is left
like a Battle Royale Game. Hence the name _Tank Royale_.

Please notice that Robocode contains no gore, no blood, no people, and no politics. The battles are simply for the
excitement of the competition that we love so much.
