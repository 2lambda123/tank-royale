# Scoring

## Calculation scores

### Bullet Damage

bots score 1 point for each point of damage they do to enemies.

### Bullet Damage Bonus

When a bot kills an enemy, it scores an additional 20% of all the damage it did to that enemy.

### Survival Score

Each bot that's still alive scores 50 points every time another bot dies.

### Last Survivor Bonus

The last bot alive scores 10 additional points for each bot that died before it.

### Ram Damage

Bots score 2 points for each point of damage they cause by ramming enemies.

### Ram Damage Bonus

When a bot kills an enemy by ramming, it scores an additional 30% of all the damage it did to that enemy.

### Total score

This is everything else added up and determines each bot's rank in this battle.

### 1sts, 2nds, 3rds

These do not actually contribute to scoring but are there to show how long the bot survived, i.e. the number of rounds the bot was placed 1st, 2nd, and 3rd.

## Score vs lone survivor

A bot will not necessarily win, just by being the last bot left on the arena, i.e. the last survivor. A bot that does not fire much, but "just" saves its energy is getting a lesser score than a bot that hits other bots with a lot of bullets. So, do not save your bullets forever just to survive. Make sure you hit with as many of your bullets as possible. The better your bot is at hitting other bots, the better your score will become.
