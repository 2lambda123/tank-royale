# History of Robocode

## Origin

The Robocode game was originally started by Mathew A. Nelson as a personal endeavour in late 2000. Mathew got inspired from the game named [Robot Battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Battle) and wanted to create a similar game using the Java programming language for the API.

## IBM AlphaWork

Robocode became a professional game when he brought it to IBM, in the form of an AlphaWorks download in July 2001. IBM AlphaWork promoted Robocode, as well as the Java programming language, with a great series of articles named [Rock 'em, sock 'em Robocode!](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-robocode/) and [Secrets from the Robocode masters](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-robotips/).

## Robocode was Open Sourced

After a couple of years, the development of Robocode stopped at IBM. Luckily, Mathew Nelson managed to convince IBM to make the source code available as Open Source. At the beginning of 2005, Robocode was brought to SourceForge as Open Source with Robocode version 1.0.7. At this point, the development of Robocode had somewhat stopped.

People from the community of Robocode, mainly driven by the [RoboWiki](http://robowiki.net/), began to develop their own versions of Robocode in order to get rid of various bugs and put new features into Robocode, the Contributions for Open Source Robocode and later on the RobocodeNG project by Flemming N. Larsen.

## Community driven

Flemming took over the Robocode project from Mathew in July 2006. The Robocode forks named RobocodeNG and Robocode 2006 containing a lot of contributions from the Robocode community were merged into the official Robocode with version 1.1 and dropped afterwards. Since then, a lot of new versions of Robocode have been released with more and more features and contributions from the community.
